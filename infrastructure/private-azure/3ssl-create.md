Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.arezibo.no.

with the following value:

9CDmmNB5vB2jUALjPYzy4wdidAs1wApVa8RVk2FPlRs

(This must be set up in addition to the previous challenges; do not remove,
replace, or undo the previous challenge tasks yet. Note that you might be
asked to create multiple distinct TXT records with the same name. This is
permitted by DNS standards.)

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.arezibo.no.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/arezibo.no/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/arezibo.no/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2024-06-13.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.
