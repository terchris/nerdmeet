# Network Architecture and security 

nerdnet uses ideas from CAF 

the goal is to have only one point where traffic from the internet...

internet traffic can only enter the network at one point,  the firewall. 

the nerdnet is segmented so that resources that needs to communicate are in the same segment.  this means that resources in one segment cannot communicate with resources in another segment without spec definition. 


we use the concept of landing zones defined in CAF to describe these segments. 

in practice each landing zone has a subnet.
